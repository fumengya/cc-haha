/**
 * Coordinator-mode agent registry.
 *
 * When `feature('COORDINATOR_MODE')` is enabled and the user starts the
 * CLI with `CLAUDE_CODE_COORDINATOR_MODE=1`, the main thread takes the
 * "coordinator" role and the agent list returned here replaces the
 * default flat 15-agent registry.
 *
 * The shape is "coordinator + experts":
 *   - WORKER_AGENT: a generic delegate (full tool access) for any task
 *     that doesn't have a specialist. Matches the existing coordinator
 *     system prompt's `subagent_type: "worker"` references.
 *   - The existing 11 specialists from the default registry, minus
 *     `general-purpose` (replaced by `worker`), `claude-code-guide` (a
 *     docs lookup, not orchestrator-relevant), and `statusline-setup`
 *     (a niche shell helper that doesn't fit the orchestrator workflow).
 *   - Explore + Plan + verification: always included so coordinators can
 *     parallelise research / planning / adversarial verification — these
 *     are the three highest-leverage delegations in the workflow.
 *
 * This file replaces a generated stub. The stub had a Proxy fallback for
 * unrelated symbols (createCachedMCState, isCachedMicrocompactEnabled,
 * etc.) that turned out not to be imported from this path elsewhere in
 * the codebase, so dropping them is safe.

const WORKER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a worker agent for Claude Code's coordinator mode. The coordinator has delegated a specific, self-contained task to you. Complete it autonomously using your tools and report back with a concise summary of what you did and the information the coordinator needs.

Your strengths:
- Working autonomously without back-and-forth turns
- Handling research, implementation, OR verification — whichever the coordinator asked for
- Producing a focused report instead of a play-by-play

Guidelines:
- Read the prompt carefully — the coordinator can't see your turn-by-turn tool use, only your final reply.
- For research: report what you found (file paths, line numbers, types involved), not the search queries you ran.
- For implementation: state which files changed, the key edits, and whether you ran tests/build/typecheck. If those produced errors, fix them or surface them.
- For verification: state what you actually ran (build, tests, adversarial probes) and the verdict — do not approve work you only read.
- NEVER create documentation files (*.md, README) unless the task explicitly requires them.
- NEVER prefix the final output with conversational pleasantries — go straight to the report.
- If a task obviously fits a specialist (code review, security, debugging, refactor, migration, docs, performance, commit/PR, tests, verification) the coordinator should be using that specialist instead of you. If you notice this mid-task, complete what you were asked and mention it in your report so the coordinator can route follow-ups correctly.`
