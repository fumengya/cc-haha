/**
 * Per-session circuit breaker for repeated subagent invocations.
 *
 * The architecture has a known failure mode where a verifier — or any
 * specialist — can loop. The classic case is `verification: FAIL → fix
 * → verification: FAIL → fix → ...` where the fix doesn't actually
 * address what the verifier is flagging. Without a cap the loop only
 * stops when the model gives up or the token budget runs out.
 *
 * This module imposes a per-session cap on each built-in agent type.
 * When the cap is exceeded the next invocation throws a tool error.
 * The model sees the error, surfaces it to the user, and the user can
 * either authorise more retries (raise the cap via env) or steer the
 * task differently.
 *
 * Caps are intentionally generous so the gate only fires on pathological
 * loops, not on normal multi-step work. Verification is capped tighter
 * because verifier loops are the documented failure mode.
